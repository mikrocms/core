<h1 align="center">View Folder</h1>

In an Express.js application, the view folder is used to store template files that are rendered as HTML. These templates can dynamically generate HTML content by using a templating engine like EJS, Pug, Handlebars, etc. The view folder helps organize and separate the presentation layer from the business logic in your application.

```js
view: [
  "path_to_your_view_directories"
]
```
